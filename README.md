# DeepLearningModel
Deep Learning Model using MNIST dataset
# MNIST Deep Learning Project

This project implements a basic deep learning model using TensorFlow to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Files
- `mnist_model.h5`: Saved model file.
- `training_logs.json`: Training logs including loss and accuracy.
- `evaluation_report.txt`: Evaluation report with test accuracy and loss.
- `mnist_deep_learning.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install TensorFlow: `pip install tensorflow`.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook and run the cells.

## Results
- Training and validation accuracy and loss curves are plotted.
- Test accuracy and loss are reported in the evaluation report.
